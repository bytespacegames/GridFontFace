# GridFontFace
Custom Font Face file type, including a converter from png to that type, a renderer and loader.
The name Grid Baller Font Face is due to the fact that the font-type is mostly intended for pixel-ish or lower resolution fonts, and that it was made for BallerOS. Could very well be used for higher-res fonts, espescially given some form of anti-aliasing.

The Renderer branch includes a Cosmos project with the Font Renderer, Loader, and a font I have created pre-installed. The Builder branch is used to build a GFF
